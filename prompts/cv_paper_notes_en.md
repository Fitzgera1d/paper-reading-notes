2.  **Layered Reading and Information Integration**:
    *   **Quick Scan & Framework Building (10 minutes)**: Quickly read the abstract, introduction, and conclusion to understand the paper's core contributions and general structure.
    *   **Detailed Dive (Core Time)**: Carefully read key sections such as methodology, experimental design, network architecture, and loss functions.
    *   **Critical Thinking & Distillation**: Annotate innovations, potential limitations, and reflect on their underlying principles and potential impact.

## Note Structure and Specific Requirements
Please organize the notes around the following structure, ensuring that each part is detailed and coherent:
